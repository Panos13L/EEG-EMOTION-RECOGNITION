# EEG_EMOTION_SEED_ML_
Classification of Emotions based on EEG Signals (SEED Dataset)
The basic idea of ​​the particular implementation is to perform emotion classification from EEG signals.

As the first categorization, handcrafted features (time-domain, frequency-domain,etc.) are used, while in the second case, categorization is carried out with a combination of handcrafted and automatic features from a CNN-LSTM network.

For both cases it is used 5-fold-cross_validation.

Based on the results, we observe an increase in classification accuracy using both type of features.
