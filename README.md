# EEG_EMOTION_SEED_ML_
Classification of Emotions based on EEG Signals (SEED Dataset)
The main idea of the approach of this implemmentation is to classify emotions from EEG signals using only handcrafted features (time-domain, frequency-domain, time-frequency-domain, features from electrodes combinations) and after this, we will make the same classification task but we are using the same handcrafted features with automated features from a CNN-LSTM network.
We will see that we have a better results when we are using both features types.
